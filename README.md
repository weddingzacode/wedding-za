## Local start

### Windows

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Double-click `START-WEDDING-ZA.bat`.
3. Keep the terminal window open.
4. The browser normally opens at `http://127.0.0.1:8088`.

The launcher checks common PHP installations including XAMPP, Laragon and WAMP.

### Manual PHP start

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8088
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8088
```

## Database setup

The public website works without MySQL.

Without MySQL:

- Shortlist is stored in the browser.
- Planner data is stored in the browser.
- Account login is unavailable unless local demo access is explicitly enabled.
- Lead forms fall back to `storage/leads.csv`.

With MySQL configured:

- Users are persistent.
- Passwords use PHP `password_hash()`.
- Host planning workspaces sync to the database.
- Vendor business profiles are persistent.
- Vendor enquiries are stored in the database.
- Vendor dashboard reads real business data.

Setup:

1. Create a MySQL database.
2. Import `database/schema.sql`.
3. Copy `config.example.php` to `config.local.php`.
4. Fill in the database credentials.
5. Set `app_url` to the production site URL.

See `database/README.md` for the short setup guide.

Never commit `config.local.php`.

For a local preview only, set `operations.allow_demo_login` to `true` (or
`WZ_ALLOW_DEMO_LOGIN=1`). Demo access also requires a loopback hostname and
client address, with no database configured. A failed production database
connection never enables demo sign-in. Keep this option disabled on GoDaddy.

## Account routes

Host:

```text
register.php?role=host
login.php?role=host
account.php
```

Vendor:

```text
register.php?role=vendor
login.php?role=vendor
register-vendor.php
vendor-dashboard.php
```

## Important files

```text
index.php
event.php
city.php
vendors.php
vendor.php
planner.php
shortlist.php
account.php
register.php
register-vendor.php
vendor-dashboard.php
invites.php
api/lead.php
api/workspace.php

includes/database.php
assets/data/site.json
assets/js/app.js
assets/js/vision.js
assets/css/app.css
assets/css/vision.css
database/schema.sql
```

## Code style

Read:

```text
docs/CODE-STYLE.md
```

Project rules include:

- one logical statement per line
- readable PHP control flow
- visibly nested HTML/PHP templates
- expanded JavaScript functions
- one CSS declaration per line
- no minified-looking source code

The repository also includes `.editorconfig`.

## Quality checks

GitHub Actions validates:

- every PHP file with `php -l`
- JavaScript syntax
- JSON validity
- clean MySQL 8 schema import
- live PHP HTTP smoke tests
- desktop Chromium routes and interactions
- mobile Chromium routes and interactions

Workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/code-quality.yml
```

## Motion dependencies

Advanced motion uses locally bundled libraries (including license notices):

- GSAP 3.15.0
- ScrollTrigger 3.15.0
- Lenis 1.3.26

The site still retains its non-pinned city rail behavior and a reduced-motion fallback.

## Production deployment

For a normal PHP shared host:

1. Upload the repository contents to the web root.
2. Use PHP 8.1 or newer.
3. Create/import the MySQL database.
4. Add `config.local.php`.
5. Ensure `storage/` is writable if CSV fallback is required.
6. Confirm Apache reads `.htaccess`.
7. Open `sitemap.php` and confirm production URLs.
8. Test host registration and login.
9. Test vendor registration and dashboard.
10. Test enquiry submission.
11. Test planner sync while logged in.
12. Enable HTTPS.

## Current external dependencies

The design still uses remote:

- Google Fonts
- Unsplash-hosted editorial imagery

For a completely self-hosted production package, replace remote editorial imagery with the client's licensed media library and choose a compliant font delivery strategy.

## Git workflow

- `main` — stable releases
- `develop` — integration branch
- `feature/*` — focused feature work
- `release/*` — final release preparation

Read:

```text
docs/DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md
```


## Admin operations

Create an admin account from the command line:

```bash
php scripts/create-admin.php "Admin Name" admin@example.com "StrongPassword123"
```

Then open:

```text
/admin/login.php
```

See `docs/OPERATIONS.md` for vendor moderation, media uploads, backups, health checks and release operations.

## Media uploads

Production media uploads support JPG, PNG and WebP.

Uploaded media is:

- MIME-validated
- size-limited
- dimension-validated
- randomly renamed
- recorded in MySQL
- blocked from PHP execution

Use only owned or properly licensed media.

## Analytics

Set `analytics.measurement_id` in `config.local.php` when your production analytics/privacy setup is ready.

Analytics remains disabled when the value is blank.


## CRM portals

Wedding Za now has four connected CRM portals.

### Customer CRM

```text
/crm/customer/
```

Includes enquiries, bookings, planning links, shortlist access, tasks, messages and customer profile.

### Vendor CRM

```text
/crm/vendor/
```

Includes sales pipeline, enquiry stages, follow-ups, opportunity value, bookings, payment state, tasks, notes, messages, business profile and portfolio media.

### Venue CRM

```text
/crm/venue/
```

Includes the Vendor CRM workflow plus venue capacity, rooms, locality/address and availability management.

### Admin CRM

```text
/admin/
```

Includes CRM enquiry assignment, bookings, customers, venues, vendors, tasks, messages, raw leads, accounts, CMS, media and audit logs.

### CRM pipeline

```text
New
→ Qualified
→ Proposal
→ Negotiation
→ Won / Lost
```

Moving an enquiry to Won creates a tentative booking automatically.

For existing installations apply:

```text
database/migrations/004-full-crm.sql
```

Then synchronize historical enquiries:

```bash
php scripts/sync-crm-leads.php
```

Full CRM documentation:

```text
docs/CRM.md
```


### Admin CRM operations

```text
/admin/
```

The Admin CRM now covers Leads, Functions, Bookings, Payments, Invoices, Refunds, Commission, Customers, Venues, Vendors, Reports, Website content inventory and Team.

Existing CRM databases should apply:

```text
database/migrations/006-admin-crm-operations.sql
```

Run Admin CRM integration QA with:

```bash
php scripts/qa-admin-crm.php
```


## Marketplace expansion upgrade

The advanced marketplace features use:

```text
database/migrations/007-marketplace-expansion.sql
```

For an existing Wedding Za MySQL database, run:

```bash
php scripts/apply-marketplace-expansion.php
```

A fresh database imported from `database/schema.sql` already includes the marketplace expansion.

The expansion includes reviews, collaborators, moodboards, notifications, vendor availability, quotes, venue-assistance purchases, recently viewed history, business analytics, richer venue/vendor fields and wedding submissions.

## Razorpay — One Wedding Venue Assist

The ₹1,000 One Wedding venue-assistance checkout is Razorpay-ready.

Add these values to `config.local.php` under the `payments` key:

```php
'payments' => [
    'razorpay_key_id' => 'rzp_test_...',
    'razorpay_key_secret' => '...',
    'razorpay_webhook_secret' => '...',
],
```

Or use environment variables:

```text
WZ_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
WZ_RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET
WZ_RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

Configure the Razorpay webhook endpoint as:

```text
https://YOUR-DOMAIN/api/razorpay-webhook.php
```

The browser only receives the public Razorpay key ID. Order creation, payment signature verification and webhook verification remain server-side.

Use Razorpay Test Mode credentials before enabling live payments.


## Email and push notifications

In-app CRM notifications remain enabled by default. The project now includes provider-ready email and push delivery with per-user preferences and delivery logging.

For an existing database, run:

```bash
php scripts/upgrade-existing-database.php
```

Then configure the optional production delivery webhook in `config.local.php`.

Full setup:

```text
docs/NOTIFICATIONS.md
```


## Final go-live gate

Before switching the production domain live, run:

```bash
php scripts/upgrade-existing-database.php
php scripts/backup-database.php
php scripts/go-live-check.php
```

Do not launch while the checker reports any `BLOCKER`.

The complete cutover runbook is:

```text
docs/GO-LIVE.md
```
